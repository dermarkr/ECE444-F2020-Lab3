Activity 3: Briefly summarize the difference between SQL or NoSQL database.

SQL Database - Relation database which stores data in tables with fixed number of columns each of which represent a type of data (e.g. name, date, mark, etc). The tables connect to each other through relationships where columns have foreign keys which reference the primary keys of rows in other tables. SQL databases are compact but very rigid in their consistency rules

NoSQL Database - They do not support relationships the way SQL databases do, resulting the the application needing to do the searching for related data. They tend to reduce to number of tables storing data which results in more data redundency. This redundency means that where in an SQL database only one piece of data may need to be changed in NoSQL is may be an expensive operation involving many changes. It also means that searching can be faster as the data exists in more places.
